/**
 * Integration test that exercises an entire heads-up match focusing on the `lastMove` field.
 *
 * Round 1: Small blind immediately folds → big blind wins.
 * Round 2: Current player shoves all-in, opponent calls → showdown → one player busts → GAME_OVER.
 *
 * The assertions verify:
 * 1. `lastMove` correctly records the last player move that closed the first round (the fold).
 * 2. The winner of the first round is the expected player (the big blind).
 * 3. After the game ends, `lastMove` is reset to `null` and a game winner is present.
